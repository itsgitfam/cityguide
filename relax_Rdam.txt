- shopping in the farmer's market: it's hosted every Tues and Sat, in front of the Markthal 
- complaining with other PhDs in the office while having the free coffee: mostly about the weather, the food, and sometimes the coffee itself
- biking: I assume. Ppl here seem to do that, but tbh I haven't really try lol
